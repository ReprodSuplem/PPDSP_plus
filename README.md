# PPDSP_Plus

This repository contains code for the **Profit-maximizing multi-vehicle Pickup and Delivery Selection Problem (PPDSP)** using multiple solvers including **Z3**, **CPLEX**, and **UWrMaxSat**.

---

## 🧩 Environment

The project uses **Python 3** and requires the following dependencies:

- `z3-solver`
- `pysat`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `cplex`

You can create and activate the environment using the included `environment.yml`:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate exp-env
```

## 🚀 Usage
The main entry point is main.py.
It accepts the following command-line arguments:

```bash
python main.py <mode> <method> <tsplib_file> <num_requests> <num_vehicles> <k-NN>
```

### Arguments
| Argument         | Description                             | Example                           |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `<mode>`         | Solver type                             | `mip`, `smt2`, `maxsat`           |
| `<method>`       | Proposed method                         | `p1`, `p2`                        |
| `<tsplib_file>`  | TSPLIB instance file name               | `burma14`,`ulysses16`             |
| `<num_requests>` | Number of pickup-delivery requests      | `7`                               |
| `<num_vehicles>` | Number of available vehicles            | `2`                               |
| `<k-NN>`         | $k$ value of $k$-NN adjacency matrix    | `4`, `0` ($0$ for complete graph)   |


## 💡 Example
Run PPDSP on a small TSPLIB instance:

```bash
# Generating instance agruments
python main.py gen ./burma14.tsp

# Solving by Z3 solver
python main.py smt2 p1 burma14 7 2 4

# Solving by CPLEX solver
python main.py mip p1 burma14 7 4 6

# Solving by UWrMaxSat solver
python main.py maxsat p2 burma14 13 2 7
```

### For maxsat mode:

In MaxSAT mode, four formulations are available: **p1**, **p2**, **p3**, and **p4**.  
They differ in how MTZ subtour elimination and capacity constraints are encoded.

- **p1**: Arithmetic MTZ + PB-based Capacity Encoding
	- MTZ constraints are encoded using **arithmetic domain variables**.
	- Encoding implemented with PySAT’s built-in:
	    - `CardEnc` (cardinality-constraint encodings) for MTZ,
	    - `PBEnc` (pseudo-Boolean encodings) for vehicle capacity constraints.
        
- **p2 (resp. p3)**: Direct Encoding (resp. Order Encoding) for MTZ + PB-based Capacity Encoding
	- MTZ constraints use a **direct encoding (resp. order encoding)** by Boolean position vector (resp. domain indicators) instead of integer variables.
	- This eliminates arithmetic comparisons and yields a pure Boolean MTZ encoding.
	- Capacity constraints are still encoded _fully_ using PySAT’s `PBEnc`, same as **p1**.
    
- **p4**: Order Encoding for MTZ + Lazy Benders Cuts for Capacity**
	- MTZ constraints use the same order encoding as **p3**.
	- Capacity constraints are _not_ encoded up front. Instead, overload violations are detected _during solving_ using:
	    - **Lazy Benders cuts**, and **clauses learning** incrementally to forbid overloaded prefixes.
	- Requires a modified version of **UWrMaxSAT** that:
		- Reads a `.meta` file to decode filtered model assignments,
		- Performs on-the-fly route reconstruction and overload checking,
		- Injects lazy clauses inside the MaxSAT solving loop.

```python
# main.py
...
elif mode == "maxsat":
...
solver.genMaxsatFormular()
solver.solve(time_limit = 3600)
...
```

UWRMaxSAT solver must be installed and accessible in your system PATH.

### For smt2 mode:

```python
# ppdsp_reform_p1_z3.py
...
def  genSmt2Formular(self):
...
self.smt2Eq3()
# Try to switch between mode 1 (arithmetic), 2 (implication), or 3 (CNF) in Eq.4 and Eq.5
self.smt2Eq4(mode=2)
self.smt2Eq5(mode=2)
self.smt2Eq6()
self.smt2Eq7()
# Try to switch between mode 2 (implication), or 3 (CNF) in Eq.8 and Eq.9
self.smt2Eq8(mode=2)
self.smt2Eq9(mode=2)
...
```

1.  _Arithmetic Mode_: Uses **arithmetic expressions** directly, such as $x \le y$. This mode keeps constraints in numerical form, allowing Z3 to reason using its arithmetic theory.

2.  _Implication Mode_: Converts logical relationships into **implication form**, e.g. $x \to y$. This treats constraints as **Boolean logic implications**, reducing solver complexity while preserving logical structure.

3.  _CNF Mode_: Encodes constraints into **Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)** using only AND/OR/NOT over Boolean literals, e.g. $\lnot x \lor y$. This form is closer to SAT encoding and often used when exporting `.wcnf` files for MaxSAT solver.

### Adding TSPLIB Instances

To add new TSPLIB datasets, simply copy the `.tsp` files into this repository and reference the filename in your command-line arguments. All `.tsp` files must be located in the same directory as main.py.

## ⚡ Quick Start
A quick guide from zero to running your first instance:

```bash
# 1️⃣ Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/ReprodSuplem/PPDSP_plus.git
cd PPDSP_plus

# 2️⃣ Create the environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate exp-env

# 3️⃣ Run a test case
python main.py gen ./burma14.tsp
python main.py maxsat p2 burma14 7 2 4
```
